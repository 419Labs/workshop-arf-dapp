# NextJS - Starknet.js - Cairo â€¢ Workshop

**StarknetCC** - Full dApp workshop by Alpha Road team

You'll find the PDF presentation [here](./files/presentation.pdf)

## Introduction

This workshop will show you how to dev a full Starknet dApp with NextJS & [Starknet.js](https://github.com/seanjameshan/starknet.js), including multi-wallets support([Argent-x](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x) | [Braavos](https://braavos.app/)) and multi-call transactions.

This repo contains the front-end part, you'll find the contracts part [here (access controller)](https://github.com/419Labs/access-controller-contracts)

You'll also use an ERC20 contract, with a 'freeMint' function added allowing you to mint up to 1k tokens per call(see [ABI](src/contracts/abis/ARF_ERC20.json)).

This workshop currently run on the **Starknet Goerli Testnet**

## Use case

Explore the contract interactions in NextJS by using an access controller contract (whitelist) & ERC20 contracts deployed on Starknet.

- Contract interactions
   - Start with existing contracts
   - Deploy & connect your own
- Access controller
   - freeSlotsCount
   - isAllowed
   - register
- Minting tokens (multicalls)


## The Goal

![TODO](./files/todo.png "Title")

## TODO

1) Familiarize a little with the project
   1) See the file tree
   2) Contract addresses are located in [contract constants](src/contracts/addresses.ts)
   3) Use of [React Context](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) to isolate code complexity
   4) (use of [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started) components library)
2) Fetching block infos
   1) Update the [StarknetProvider](src/context/StarknetProvider/manager.ts) to connect to the default Starknet provider by using [Starknet.js](https://github.com/seanjameshan/starknet.js)
   2) Update the [BlockProvider](src/context/BlockProvider/provider.tsx), use the current provider to fetch current block infos
   3) (The UI part is already done here)
3) Wallet connect
   1) Look at the [WalletConnect button component](src/components/wallet/WalletConnect.tsx)
   2) Update the "connectBrowserWallet" [StarknetProvider](src/context/StarknetProvider/manager.ts) to ask user wallet connection by using [get-starknet library](https://github.com/starknet-community-libs/get-starknet)
      1) Update the default provider by the user provider
   3) You should be able to connect with Braavos or ArgentX, and see your current address on the UI
4) Your first transaction
   1) Start by taking a look at the [Contract Provider model](src/context/ContractProvider/model.ts)
   2) You can now update the [RegisterWhitelist component](src/components/wallet/RegisterWhitelist.tsx) to
      1) Fetch the total free slots currently available
      2) Fetch the current whitelisted status of the connected account
      3) Register to the whitelist if there is free slots & the connected account is not currently whitelisted
5) Multi-call
   1) Look at the [MultiMint component](src/components/wallet/MultiMint.tsx)
   2) Here you'll have to
      1) Fetch balances of arfBTC & arfETH when needed
      2) Mint both arfBTC & arfETH in 1 TX using the multicall
   3) (You can also make a 'register to whitelist + mint token' in 1 TX as well)
6) Deploy your own Access Controller
   1) You can put aside IDE for the time & open your terminal
   2) clone the [access-controller](https://github.com/419Labs/access-controller-contracts) repo
      1) ``> git clone git@github.com:419Labs/access-controller-contracts.git``
   3) Use nile to compile & deploy the contracts
      1) ``> nile compile``
      2) ``> nile deploy AccessController --alias my_access_controller [...args] --network=goerli``
      3) Wait until the contract is deployed
         1) You can check the status of the TX by calling [get_transaction](https://docs.starknet.io/docs/CLI/commands#starknet-get_transaction) on the starknet cli
   4) Once it's ok, you can test it by calling *freeSlotsCount* on the deployed contract
      1) With Nile CLI
      2) With the [voyager](https://goerli.voyager.online/)
   5) You can now replace the ACCESS_CONTROLLER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS in [the contract constants](src/contracts/addresses.ts) to use your own
7) Add your feature
   1) In this part you'll add your own feature from A to Z
   2) Start by choosing the feature you want to implement
      1) Remove from whitelist, Get a list of all whitelisted addresses, ...
   3) Implement the feature on the [AccessController_base contract](https://github.com/419Labs/access-controller-contracts/blob/main/contracts/libraries/AccessController_base.cairo) & Add the corresponding @view or @external interface on the [AccessController contract](https://github.com/419Labs/access-controller-contracts/blob/main/contracts/AccessController.cairo)
   4) Compile & Deploy your new contract
      1) Get the new abi.json & update the [current one](src/contracts/abis/AccessController.json)
   5) Implement the new feature on the UI
      1) By create a new component in */src/components/wallet* & add it in the [index](src/pages/index.tsx)

## Go further

There some improvements you can make to improve this workshop, here is a non-exhaustive list:

- Save transactions in local storage
- Display current transaction information on the UI (toast, history panel, ...)
- Auto reload of: whitelisted after register, balance after mint
- Implement a button to be able to add a specific token to your wallet
- ...

## Docs

Here is all the docs you'll need to complete the workshop

## Helps

Work with **big numbers** in JavaScript could be a mess.
As you'll probably use the 18 decimals standard for the token balances, you'll not be able to store it as a Number but as a string representation.
To abstract the complexity, you can use the well known [Ether.js library](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/) (especially the formatUnits & parseUnits)
in completion of the [Starknet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/API/utils#number) helpers(toFelt, bnToUint256, ...)
